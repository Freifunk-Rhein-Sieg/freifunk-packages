Gluon script to enable special treatment for single nodes based on their MACs. You can than do slight corrections to single nodes via an update which is especially useful if you don't have ssh access.

Basically you HAVE to have your own repository of gluon-treatment where you put your files for every single node you want to change, the example repo will do nothing than deleting itself.

put it into your modules file - changing example to your repository - and add gluon-treatment to your site.mk.

You have to create a file for each node you want modify with the MAC address of br-client as its filename. The MAC of the node is the same as the primary MAC you can see in meshviewer. See the example file in files/lib/gluon/treatment/macs.

The script will run once via a cronjob, check for treatment files, execute a matching one and delete everything afterwards.

It's a hack, but quite convenient to correct things like deprecated branches.

Here are some example treatment contents, you can add as much and creatively as you want.
